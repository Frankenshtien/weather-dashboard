# Weather Dashboard Challenge

## In this challenge I was tasked with creating a weather application using the Open Weather Map Api. I had to create all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**My Process**

- I created the basic layout for the page using HTML and used the Bootstrap CSS library to style it.

- I created an event listener that ran a function using a text box value when a search button was pressed.

- The function that runs after the "click" takes the text box value and concatenates it in to the Open Weather Map API fetch request. It then calls the function to adds the weather information that it got back to the page.

- When that function finishes running it calls another to get the 5 day forecast, and appends that information to the page.
